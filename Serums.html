    <h1>Best Oil Control Serums</h1>
<p> This is the one of the serums that I recommend to help control the oil.

<p>This is something that I got in a mini kit that I bought from my job. It is a salicylic acid serum that is good for discoloration , acne control and oil control. 
Because of the consistency, a little goes a long way, so purchasing the serum is a good investment because it will last you a very long time. I use this at night before bed to let it work its magic while I sleep. 
I don’t use this product every night because I don’t want my skin to become used to salicylic acid and lose its effectiveness. 
From my experience, if it is used consistently you can see visible results in just a week.
