    <h1>Best Oil Control Cleansers</h1>
<p> I use various cleansers on my face depending on the time of day or whether or not I am going to wear make-up. My absolute favorite, go to cleanser that I will use at LEAST
once a day is the Clinique Liquid Facial Soap IV for oily skin.

<p>I really like this cleanser because it gives me that drying feeling that I really strive for but it also still really gentle on the skin. It is the first step in the 3-step system from the brand and yes I do use it in conjunction with the other two products from the system. I personally don’t think you need to use the whole line, if you just want to use the soap you’re more than welcome to do so but obviously products designed to work together will give you a better result.
