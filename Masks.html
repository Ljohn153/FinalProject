    <h1>Best Oil Control Masks</h1>
<p> This is my favorite mask for controlling the shine.

<p>The Himalayan Charcoal Purifying Glow Mask was something I stumbled upon at the mall one day but I’m glad that I did. 
Clay masks are an oily person’s best friend and this mask is no different. It has chunks of charcoal in it that aid in the absorption of oil and impurities while also doubling as an exfoliator when you remove the mask. 
As it dries on your face you an see the oil being sucked out of your pores, it is a truly beautiful sight. Finally, once you wash the mask off of your face you skin will literally be glowing. 
It’s in the name and they did not lie. 
I love this mask and if you decide to try it, you will too.
