    <h1>Best Oil Control Toners</h1>
<p> This is the toner that I recommend for oily skin.

<p>This is a liquid exfoliator that I use by putting it on a cotton pad and wiping it around my face, neck, and ears after Iâ€™m done cleansing. 
Exfoliation is an important step of skin health especially if you have oily skin. This toner offers a gentle exfoliation that you can immediately feel after use. 
It does exactly what it says its supposed to do and I absolutely love it.
